            <!-- <h3 class="greeting">Welcome to my World! </h3>-->

                <p class="mid">
                    Welcome! I'm Alexis, a University of Florida senior working toward a B.A. in Digital Arts and Sciences with minors in Computer Science and Mass Communications.
                </p> 

                <p class="mid"> 
                    After completing my academic journey, I intend to continue exploring emerging technologies. I'm fascinated by virtual and augmented reality, simple and efficient user experience, gamification in education, visual jockeying, and interaction design. I'm learning these skills not only to enhance the creative engineering community but to one day benefit society as a whole.
                </p>

                <p class="boom"> 
                    Communication, art, and technology limitlessly intersects, and I intend to use my skills to pioneer uncharted territory in this booming age of interactivity, immersion and innovation. 
                </p>

                <p class="midd">
                    When I'm not creating music videos or designing user interfaces, you can find me exploring near and far, jamming out to live music, watching psychological thrillers, or playing with my puppy <a href="#" class="nala">Nala<img src="images/nalas.png"/></a> .

                            <p class="sides">In <a href="http://www.ufverg.com/">UF's Virtual Experience Research Group</a>, we simulate personalized virtual reality experiences to train medical professionals and newly the police force through human-computer interaction. Currently, Daniel Sepler and I have paired up with the UF Police Department to reenact a role play situation of a cop that has received a call from a pharmacist. As the cop, you walk in to CVS and must interact and then calm down a bipolar women who is having a panic attack because she is unable to receive more medication. <br><br> The experience will be presented and used by the UFPD. We have conducted psychological research to conduct the experience and are using Unity 3D and Maya.

                                My partner, Sky Mardiat, and I are prototyping an application that we have been working on since October. Coming from our rapidly evolving multidisciplinary field, we are collaborating to create a social professional platform to organize all these booming ideas in to cohesive projects, products, and productivity. NewFaces seeks to provide a convenient platform for researchers, artists, designers, engineers and entrepreneurs to network and share their ideas with other new people, or new faces. <br><br>Our intention is to bring together potential collaborators and powerful, passionate minds who would have otherwise never met.

                            <p class="sides">As our Senior Project, Kendall Robertson and I are creating an interactive virtual reality music video. It will be set to the song, Paper Dreams, a recently recorded single from local Gainesville artist Ysatis Hernandez and her accompaniment rapper Cliff. The video allows users to
        “look around” at the world around them in real"time as the music plays using VR headsets like Google Cardboard and the Oculus Rift, or simply the arrow keys on the video. Rather than using only real life videography, our goal is to create a virtual “fantasy world” where we will use multiple digital design platforms to model, map, animate, and composite this virtual “world”.<br><br>We are using the After Effects plug-in Skybox Studio by Mettle which allows us to create animated environment maps to be used with 3D models. We will also be using the Element 3D plug-in and the DomeMaster 3D plug-in in Maya. The video will be published at the end of April. Stay tuned!
