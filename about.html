                <p class="mid">
                    Welcome! I'm Alexis, a University of Florida senior working toward a B.A. in Digital Arts and Sciences with minors in Computer Science and Mass Communications.
                </p> 

                <p class="mid"> 
                    After I graduate in December, I intend to continue exploring emerging technologies. I'm fascinated by virtual and augmented reality, simple and efficient user experience, gamification in education and psychology, and interaction design and development. I'm learning these skills not only to enhance the creative engineering community but to one day benefit society as a whole. 
                </p>

                <p class="boom"> 
                    Communication, art, and technology limitlessly intersects, and I intend to use my skills to pioneer uncharted territory in this booming age of interactivity, immersion and innovation. 
                </p>

                <p class="midd">
                    Currently, I enjoy for various local Gainesville artists creating content for shows and live visual jockeying. When I'm not creating music videos or designing user interfaces, you can find me exploring near and far, jamming out to live music, watching psychological thrillers, or playing with my puppy <a id="nala" href="#" class="nala" id="nala">Nala<img src="images/nalas.png"/></a> .

                            <p class="sides">In <a id="verg" href="http://www.ufverg.com/">UF's Virtual Experience Research Group</a>, we simulate personalized virtual reality experiences to train medical professionals and the police force through human-computer interaction. Currently, Daniel Sepler and I have paired up with the UF Police Department and the Crisis Intervention Training Center to reenact role play situations. In this situation, as cop the cop you receive a call from dispatch from a pharmacist. You then walk in to CVS and must interact, empathize, and calm down a bipolar women who is having a panic attack because she is unable to receive more medication. <br><br> The experience will be presented and used by the UFPD. We have conducted psychological research to conduct the experience and are using Unity 3D and Maya. We have presented our beta and have gotten positive feedback. With a new grant, are now working on our Alpha to present at the CIT International Annual Conference.

                            <p class="sides">I have a passion for traveling and exploring the world. As a new project, I want to create a plug-in for Facebook to connect friends and travel. Have you seen a friend that has taken a trip that you think you would have enjoyed? Do you know someone who lived somewhere that you are visiting and want to know what places they would suggest?<br><br>Using location APIs and the user's permission, you can share with your friends where you suggest without having to track it your self and spark this sense of social traveling.

                               The VR / AR revolution is booming. With a computer, communications, and engineering background, and a passion for combining these skills to create magic, I was quickly introduced to various VR projects. Through ACM, I decided to start building a VR community at UF to bring students, teachers, and researchers from different fields interested in VR development together. We are promoting the research and development of virtual and augmented reality applications and will be starting Fall 2016. With our recent Cry Engine lab grant, we want to arm students with the tools and resources they need to pursue the future of VR computing and work with this cutting-edge technology. 
  <br><br>We will connect students with professors and industry leaders, hold workshops and build project teams to give students first-hand exposure to VR and AR, yet most importantly create a VR community here at UF for future collaboration and interests.
